# Introduction #

XCode is fast becoming a great IDE for all sorts of development on the Mac OS X platform. XCode has a powerful plugin architecture but unfortunatly Apple has not released any documentation on

# What Next #

A good place to start would be to create a new project with the type "AppleScript Xcode Plug-in". Don't worry about the AppleScript part as you do not need to use AppleScript any more than you want to. If you are defining a new programming language you need to create one or more of the files defined in [Specifications](Specifications.md) and place them inside the **Resources** folder.

Then it would be smart to add a [Documentation Set](DocumentationSets.md) for your developers.
